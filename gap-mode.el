;; Version: 2.0
;; Keywords: gap
;; URL: https://bitbucket.org/gvol/gap-mode

;; This file is part NOT of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides fontification, indentation, and local variable
;; functionality, for GAP code.  It also provides help and completion
;; by asking an inferior GAP process.
;;
;; Evaluating (customize-group 'gap) is an easy way to see what
;; options are available.

;;; Install:

;; Copy this file to somewhere in your load path, then put the
;; following lines in your .emacs file:
;;
;;      (autoload 'gap-mode "gap-mode" "GAP editing mode" t)
;;      (setq auto-mode-alist (apply 'list
;;                                   '("\\.g\\'" . gap-mode)
;;                                   '("\\.gap\\'" . gap-mode)
;;                                   auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; Then visiting any file ending in ".g" or ".gap" will automatically put
;; you in gap-mode.  Alternatively, to enter gap-mode at anytime, just type
;;    M-x gap-mode

;;; History:

;; v1.96 -
;; * Added a flag to choose whether the complete command (ESC-tab) simply
;;   calls dynamic abbreviation (dabbrev-expand), the default, or tries
;;   to complete the word by asking a running gap process.
;; v1.95 -
;; * Fixed bug in 'gap-insert-local-variables. It was only picking up
;;   variables that were the first on the line - a big problem.
;;   Finally fixed the treatment of local function definitions. It will
;;   now skip over locally defined functions when compiling the local
;;   variable list.
;; v1.92 -
;; * Defined my own "memberequal" function for checking strings in lists.
;; v1.90 -
;; * Fixed a bug in gap-insert-local-variables (stray "," appearing).
;; * Added variables gap-local-statement-format and
;;   gap-local-statement-margin for controlling format of local
;;   variable statement inserted. It now wraps the line correctly.
;; v1.85 -
;; * Added variables gap-insert-debug-name, gap-insert-debug-string to
;;   allow customization of debugging/print statements inserted by function
;;   gap-insert-debug-print.
;; v1.80 -
;; * New function gap-insert-local-variables for inserting a local variable
;;   statement for the current function at the point.
;; v1.70 -
;; * New function gap-insert-debug-print for inserting Inform(... lines.
;; v1.60 -
;; * Fixed the add-local-variable function so that it skips over local
;;   statements of functions defined within the current function.
;; v1.55 -
;; * Added a regular expression for gin-mode, and changed the fill region
;;   function to check if gin-mode is on, if so and in a comment, do
;;   fill-paragraph instead of indent region. Does this make sense?
;; v1.51 -
;; * Fixed silly error due to copying a magma-mode function across.
;; v1.50 -
;; * Fixed the function that leaps across if..else..fi and similar stmts.
;; v1.40 -
;;* Added new function 'gap-add-local-variable.
;; v1.30 -
;; * changed code to make it more compatible with outline-minor-mode.
;;   Many changes to regular expressions, adding "\C-m" whenever "\n"
;;   occurs, and modifiying many beginning-of-line etc functions.
;; v1.25 -
;; * eliminated bug introduced in last modification.
;; v1.20 -
;; * Made the special continued line handling more versatile.
;; v1.10 -
;; * Cleaned up code immensely. Should be much easier to understand.
;; * Fixed some bugs in special indentation checking where it could get
;;   confused with the contents of GAP strings (eg a ":=" in a string).
;; v1.01 -
;; * Just changed some defaults.
;; v1.00 -
;; * First release version.
